# Machine Learning Examples
Various machine learning case studies.

- MAPE regression (training in Keras + geometric insights)
- Mixture of Experts (fitting a mixture of models, such as NNs...)
- [Malfunction Likelihood by Recurrent Neural Networks](DeviceFailure.ipynb), a case study on device failure temporal data
- [Anomaly Detection by Recurrent Neural Networks](Temporal_AnomDetect_NNs.ipynb) in Time Series Families (intraday data)
- Random Embeddings vs PCA as Feature Extractors 
- [Piecewise Linear Models](Bayes_PiecewiseLinModel.ipynb) trained by Bayesian Inference 
- [Robust Feature Selection](Predicting_HeartDisease.ipynb) on Heart Disease Dataset
- [Autoencoders help in small dimension](https://github.com/maciejskorski/ml_examples/blob/master/AutoEncoder_HeartDisease.ipynb), case study on Framingham Heart Study Data
- [Hessian approximation](https://github.com/maciejskorski/ml_examples/tree/master/approx_hessian) for Neural Networks 
- [Employee Attrition Model](https://github.com/maciejskorski/ml_examples/blob/master/EmployeeAttrition_TF.ipynb) trained in TF and productionalized in Colab with REST api 
- [Heat Waves Models](https://github.com/maciejskorski/ml_examples/blob/master/HeatWaves_Models.ipynb), trained with various Python framworks (statsmodels, GPFlow, PyMC3) and used for sample hypotheses testing
